== Best WordPress Event Management Plugin ==
Fortunately, though WordPress doesn’t enable these functions out of the box, there’s a plugin you can use. Modern Events Calendar is an easy way to manage events of all kinds on your WordPress site. As the name suggests, the core benefit of Modern Events Calendar is that it lets you create an events calendar that looks pretty great out of the box. That latter part is important because some popular event calendar plugins require a lot of custom styling to make them look good, which is tough if you don’t know your way around CSS.

== Covid-19 (Coronavirus) ==
In MEC 5.2.5 we've prepared 3 very important features to help you during the Covid-19 pandemic. You can now display normal labels and the reason for the event's cancelation in shortcodes and the Single Event Page. You can also set a url for your locations so your location can act as a URL display for livestreams/webinars. 

There is also a feature that was added in the last update. Once you set the status of an event, those changes are reflected in the schema as well so that Google can detect your events' status easier.[Read More](https://webnus.net/modern-events-calendar/covid-19/)

>The Modern Events Calendar plugin combined with Divi’s beautiful layouts are an effective combination both in design and functionality. To start things off I’m going to go through the settings we need to get the functionality we want for our event scheduling and booking. There are a ton of options available which really is empowering when you are trying to perfect the user experience when scheduling or booking events.
><strong>Jason Champagne on Elegant Themes Blog</strong>

>Hence the name, Modern Events Calendar Lite is a WordPress plugin that follows all the latest trends and regulations. When it comes to creating the niftiest event calendars, this tool might be the perfect solution for what you are up to. And if you are already using another plugin, but you are not fully satisfied, you can import the data quickly and effortlessly, too. The process of setting up the calendar that you require is simple and swift.
><strong>Vishnu on Colorlib Blog</strong>

>As the name suggests, the core benefit of Modern Events Calendar is that it lets you create an events calendar that looks pretty great out of the box. That latter part is important because some popular event calendar plugins require a lot of custom styling to make them look good, which is tough if you don’t know your way around CSS. Modern Events Calendar lets you create great-looking event displays right out of the box, along with advanced features like ticketing and a custom event display builder. You can even integrate with Elementor for more design flexibility, and WooCommerce for more ticketing/payment flexibility.
><strong>Colin Newcomer on WPlift Blog</strong>

>Many WordPress site owners can benefit from having an online booking system. Integrated online event registration helps your customers purchase tickets, schedule appointments, and sign up for events whenever it’s convenient for them. When it comes to managing events in WordPress, Modern Events Calendar really has it all. From simple calendar displays to personalized bookings with variable tickets, you can create the perfect system to meet your site’s needs.
><strong>Will Morris on WPmayor Blog</strong>

>If you are running an event website or you want to start a WordPress powered website with booking services, you need a managed WordPress hosting that will not disappoint you and a strong and practical plugin that can provide all the required features. The most important factor in such projects is the user-friendly environment the plugin creates. In this regard, both Lite and Pro versions of Modern Events Calendar (MEC) can help you.
><strong>Mustaasam Saleem on Cloudways Blog</strong>

>The Modern Events Calendar plugin says quite a bit in its name, since it’s a high-quality, professional, and modern take on your standard events management layout. You can choose from a wide variety of designs, making it an excellent solution for branding and fitting in your website. It also includes a powerful booking system at only $34. Since this is sold on CodeCanyon you’re also signing up for a year of premium support, beating out some of those free plugins we’ve talked about earlier.
