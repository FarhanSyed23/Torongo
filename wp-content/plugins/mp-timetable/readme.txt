= Key advantages =

**Responsive design.** It's optimized to be viewed perfectly on different devices. A good step forward, the plugin was supplied with the ability to manually adjust the way to show your timetable on mobile devices and desktops.

**A well thought-out toolkit of shortcode settings.** It eliminates the difficulties of timetabling as all preferable settings can be applied in minutes. Each setting is supplied with sufficient clarifications to ensure you coordinate and edit your events fast without additional help.   

**Handy event filtering.** The visitors can filter the timetable to display the only events they are interested in.

**Color controls.** Highlight important activities by presenting them in different colors. Additionally, it simplifies and speeds up the search as the needed events marked with the same color can be noticed faster even without being filtered. Various color markers can become helpful in making the timetable more colorful or in customizing it to fit your website color scheme.

**More precise visual time frames.** Hourly time frames are generally large enough for showing the events, but using the MotoPress Timetable plugin you still can increase them by setting the timetable to show up to 15 minutes accurate time in the left 'time' column.  

**Flexibility.** If any unexpected delays or total dates' changes take place, your timetable can bend easily in one direction or another thanks to a couple of qucik time edits in the backend.
