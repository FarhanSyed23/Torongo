== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do I publish my image slider? =
You can publish your slider by using WordPress native short-codes or you can call do_shortcode() function.

= 2. Can I customize slider design? =
Yes, you have a full control on design customization. You can customize fonts, colors, dimensions and whatever you need to make the slider fit your website and branding.

= 3. Is multicolumn carousel slider available? =
Yes, it's supported slider style! Yoo Slider supports multiple slider layout styles, as well as carousel and coverflow styles.

= 4. Should I concern about migration? =
No, you should not! Yoo Slider uses WordPress media gallery items which links are being generated by WordPress on fly. So, if you migrate your WordPress website properly, there shouldn’t be any issues with images used in your image slider.

= 5. Is Yoo Slider responsive? =
Yoo Slider is 100% responsive and mobile friendly, so it fits perfectly into your page, regardless of the screen size.

= 6. What should I do if I see blank are instead my image slider? = 
Most probably you have JavaScript errors on your site which blocks other scripts, so prevents the slider to be rendered properly. Try to open up the browser debugger window with F12 button to check the console if it shows error or not. 

Usual it's because you have the up to date WordPress version, but your theme uses old jQuery version. So, WordPress throws a JavaScript error. It could be resolved by removing the old jQuery from your theme’s functions.php.

= 7. Can I customize slider fonts? =
If you're running Yoo Slider Premium, then the answer is YES, you can!

= 8. How can I include my image slider in a post or page? = 
Put this short code wherever you want to include your video or image slider: [yooslider id=Here comes the slider id]

= 9. How to include my image slider into header.php? = 
Do this php call to get the slider included in any php script: <?php echo do_shortcode('[yooslider id=Here comes the slider id]'); ?>

= 10. Does Yoo Slider support sites with SSL? = 
Yes, it does! Yoo Slider works fine for both protocols, either http:// or https://
