== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do I add the slider to my site? =
You can add your slider by shortcode or via the widget control panel or PHP shortcode.

= 2. Where can I reach the documentation? =
[https://smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com//](https://smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com//)

= 3. Where is Canvas mode? =
Canvas mode was renamed to [Absolute](
https://smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1916-slide-editing-in-smart-slider-3#absolute). You can add Absolute layers using the toggle at the Add panel, and [switch a Default layer to Absolute](https://smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1916-slide-editing-in-smart-slider-3#faq) at layer window > Style tab > Position.

But we recommend working with [Default layers](
https://smartslider.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1916-slide-editing-in-smart-slider-3#default) because the responsive behavior is better, and the slide building is much faster. Most layouts people want to create can be done with Default layers only. Absolute mode should only be used for decoration.

= 4. What should I do when I see blank area where the slider should show or the slider doesn't work? =
It means that there is a JavaScript error on your site which blocks other scripts(for example Smart Slider's scripts). You can open up the browser debugger window with F12 button and check the console if it shows error or not. If you solve these errors Smart Slider should work fine.

Usual problem is that you have the latest WordPress version, but your theme loads very old jQuery version (1.7 or older) and the WordPress admin bar throws a JavaScript error. In this case, you have to remove the old jQuery from your theme's functions.php.

If you are unable to solve these problems, feel free to [contact us!](https://smartslider3.com/help/)

= 5. What should I do when I experience any problem? =
[Contact us!](https://smartslider3.com/contact-us/support/)

= 6. Is Smart Slider 3 is totally responsive? =
Smart Slider 3 is 100% responsive with each items, so it will fit perfectly into your page, regardless of the size of your desktop screen or device.

= 7. Can I customize the fonts of the slider? =
Yes you can customize everything for every state. (hover, active, opened) The slider comes with Google Web Font support, allowing you to pick from over a dozen font families. To make using Google Fonts even easier, we have created a font manager interface that simplifies the process and preview it.

= 8. Can I show multiple instances of slider on one page? =
Yes you can use multiple slider widgets and slider shortcodes.

= 9. How to include a slider in a post or a page? =
`[smartslider3 slider=Here comes the slider id]`

= 10. How to include a slider into header.php or other PHP files? =
`&lt;?php echo do_shortcode(&#039;[smartslider3 slider=Here comes the slider id]&#039;); ?&gt;`

= 11. Does Smart Slider support sites with SSL? =
Of course! Smart Slider use protocol relative urls which works fine on http:// and on https:// too.
