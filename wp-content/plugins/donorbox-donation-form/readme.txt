Since transitioning to Donorbox we have not had a single donor contact us saying they were having trouble setting up a gift. In fact, we've had several donors tell us how easy the new process is. The Donorbox team has been extremely responsive when we need help and have already implemented suggestions for future features. I have no hesitations recommending Donorbox to you."*
