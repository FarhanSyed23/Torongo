            There are different ways to sync events depending on the source calendar provider. All of them require you to get their ‘ICS’ (international calendar standard) feed. <br><br>

            <ul>
                <div>Look for a button on their calendar with any of the following buttons:</div>
                <li>ICS</li>
                <li>iCal</li>
                <li>Subscribe</li>
                <li>Feed</li>
                <li>Export</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Often you need to click to get the ‘Copy Link Address’. Once you have the ICS feed, you can paste it into your Timely calendar Import Feeds section.
            <br><br>
            Specific documentation & videos for each major source calendar provider are found <a href="https://time.ly/document/sourcing-pulling-in-local-feeds/">here</a>
            <br><br>
            Approximately 1 in 10 website calendars can export a feed. For those that don’t, you can ask to get their own Timely calendar <a href="https://time.ly/website-calendar-pricing">https://time.ly/website-calendar-pricing</a> which you will be able to pull/sync events from.
            <br><br>
            You can also do a web search for calendars, ie:<br>
            “Music” & “Toronto” & “Timely calendar”
            <br><br>
            The <a href="https://time.ly/website-calendar-pricing">Timely Hub</a> calendar allows you to search for local Timely calendars and add their events directly via your own dashboard. We call this EventDiscovery.
