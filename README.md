# Torongo
 
Torongo is a web project which we built for an organization named “Torongo”. Our vision was to build an official website for a social working organization like Torongo who can use this website platform to connect with more people and encourage people to contribute to the noble social responsibilities performed by such organization or a community who are working dedicatedly towards betterment of the society. We successfully built a demo website which fulfilled our vision. The website for Torongo was built with WordPress and as it is a demo version which we want to make into a live website, is currently hosted in a local server. It can be transferred into a domain server anytime. Here on Torongo, visitors who will visit the website can learn about the organization and the works they do. They can learn about the organizing body of the team who leads the organization. The projects facilitated by the organization are categorically shown in a page as completed, ongoing and upcoming projects with full details. If Torongo will require volunteers for an upcoming project, they can post a notice for volunteer recruitment which will be shown as a notice to the viewer. Any interested visitor who wants to join as a volunteer after seeing all the information and social projects of this organization can join as temporary or permanent volunteer for Torongo. They can contact them via mail, subscribe to notices and get connected via social feed like Facebook, Messenger chat service. The most important feature this website will provide is the donation. People can contribute financially to this organization by using the online payment gateway and the offline payment information and can be a part of eliminating discrimination from our society.
